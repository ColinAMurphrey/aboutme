                    <h1>What Made me Start my Web Design Career?</h1>

                    <p class="last-modified" id="sudo"></p>
                    
                    <hr>

                    <p>
                        My web design career starts at a very odd place when compared to many.
                        When I was little (maybe around 12 years old), I wanted to be a marine biologist.
                        Why does that relate?
                        It relates because I didn't know what I wanted to do at the time I decided I wanted to be a marine biologist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because of this lack of motivation to get my life started, my father introduced to me coding.
                        He showed me a program called Scratch.
                        Scratch is a program that can arguably also be called a programming language.
                        However, instead of typing the code in a text editor, the code is actually drag-and-droppable.
                        I fell in love with this.
                        In fact, it made me think about how I enjoyed going to the computer lab when I was at school.
                    </p>


                    <h2>How I began learning</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the 8th grade, I decided to take a typing course as one of my electives.
                        I wanted to learn how to type properly before I go into Computer Programming in high school.
                        While I wasn't too confident during the beginning of the semester I started taking that course, I eventually was hitting 50 words per minute, sometimes 60.
                        That's just within four months of taking a typing course.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When high school came around, I started selecting courses.
                        My counselor for high school thought that it would have been a poor idea to start out in Computer Programming.
                        She stated that some students left that class crying.
                        She thought that I couldn't handle that.
                        Actually, I don't blame her.
                        I wasn't the brightest student ever, and that was considered an Advanced level class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For my freshman year of high school, my counselor decided to put me in a web design course called "Web Mastering".
                        I actually made some good friends in that course, but I still wish I was taking the Computer Programming course at the time.
                        In Web Mastering, I was actually a great student.
                        Web designed seemed easy.
                        I pretty much flew right through that class without problems.
                    </p>
                    

                    <h2>Beginning with Computer Programming</h2>
                    <p>
                        During my sophomore year, my counselor had advised me to take Animation, given that the Computer Programming teachers were entirely full of students and couldn't accept any more.
                        So, I had to skip another year of Computer Programming to start in my junior year.
                        Finally, though, I was able to take the course I have been wanting to take since my freshman year of high school.
                        It was an easy breeze.
                        I didn't have any issues taking that course whatsoever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In that course, we learned Java and Python.
                        Java was taken during the entire first semester of that year, and then Python was taken during the second semester.
                        I enjoyed Python far more than Java, but I still enjoyed Java nevertheless.
                    </p>


                    <h2>Where the pain started</h2>
                    <p>
                        Fast-forwarding to my senior year, I was taking Computer Science AP Advanced (this course taught Java).
                        Maybe my counselor was wrong about Computer Programming and people leaving that class crying.
                        Maybe, it was Computer Science AP Advanced that people left the class crying.
                        I hated this course and I wished I had listened, maybe even choose a different career path.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the middle of the second semester of taking that course, I have decided to change career paths.
                        Maybe it's intentional without letting the students know, but Computer Science teachers don't teach after the first "Intro to Comp Sci" course.
                        Why?
                        I wouldn't know.
                        But, that's how the whole year went for me during that course.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along with not being properly taught, we were required to teach ourselves recursion.
                        If you don't already know, recursion is usually the most painful part when taking a Computer Science course.
                        Given that the course was also teaching Java, this made the entire portion of the course an absolute pain.
                        We had an entire test that went over recursion.
                        After that test, I decided to switch career paths to Information Technology.
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <h2>After graduating high school</h2>
                    <p>
                        After graduation, I decided to go into Computer Information Systems at a local community college.
                        That is, until I met my girlfriend, who now her and I go to the same university together (as of writing this).
                        At first, I had plans to transfer from Lone Star College, in Houston, to the University of Houston.
                        My girlfriend, however, had other plans.
                        She had several options in mind, all located in Houston: Houston Baptist University, University of St. Thomas, or University of Houston.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's somewhat of a funny story as of why we both decided against University of Houston, but I promised her that we would go to school together.
                        Given this, I decided against transferring to receive my Bachelor's of Science at the University of Houston, and instead decide to go to school with her at the University of St. Thomas.
                        Originally, I had intended to get my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at the University of St. Thomas.
                        My budget had other plans.
                        So, I decided to go for my Associate's of Applied Science in Cybersecurity.
                    </p>


                    <h2>When I got back into programming</h2>
                    <p>
                        While she was busy taking too many credit-hours worth of classes (18, to be exact), I decided to start again with coding by using the Shortcuts app built into iOS.
                        I made automations that would tell her good morning (yes, she was okay with this), getting the weather, and letting her know when I would be at her house to pick her up for school.
                        These automations were small and also contained primarily drag-and-drop code, so I decided that I wanted to branch out and start programming again, three years after graduating from high school.
                        I first started with Python.
                        I decided Python would have been great given that it is much easier to learn compared to picking Java back up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given my networking knowledge at the time, I thought it would have been a great idea to get the weather data using Python and the OpenWeatherMap API to then SSH that data to my phone every morning.
                        The design was very weird and sometimes didn't work, but it was more flexible than using the Shortcuts apps.
                        After learning some Python, I then decided to branch back out into HTML and CSS.
                        Using another weird method of getting the data, I had actually used Python code to right to an HTML file about every minute.
                        Why use Python to get the weather data?
                        That would be because I had no idea how to use JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eventually, I finished an early product of what I called "Weather Station".
                        It was a basic website that only contained the temperature and chance of precipitation.
                        Not only that, but it only looked good when using an Official Raspberry Pi Touchscreen.
                        That is, until I learned Bootstrap.
                    </p>


                    <h2>Publishing a website</h2>
                    <p>
                        By this point, I have published a basic weather website called <a href="https://geoweather.me" target="_blank">Geoweather</a>.
                        Geoweather is actually a huge feat for me, given that I am the first and youngest in my family to publish a website, as well as it being a massive milestone in my coding career.
                        However, in the future, this website will no longer be available, given that the API that I am using is currently on a student paid plan.
                        Basically, I received a student discount that gave me an advanced version of the API for only a year.
                        As of writing this, the website is still up and available for users to use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By this point, if you are experience with programming for websites, you may be asking, "how did he get the weather data with a Python script but for a website?"
                        The even more experienced programmers would think that I'm using Python for the entire website.
                        Actually, I ended up learning JavaScript specifically for Geoweather.
                        Yes, it was a pain, and probably the most difficult language that I've learned within the past year of learning to code, but I've made it work for this website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Originally, I had the website port forwarded from my Raspberry Pi.
                        I didn't like this, given that it was exposing my home network to the world, so I eventually had gotten a Github student account.
                        This had then granted me a student discount for a domain name service provider called Namecheap.
                        Their student discount gives out <code>.me</code> domain names for free.
                        Given this extension, I have used my free voucher for <a href="https://geoweather.me" target="_blank">Geoweather</a>.
                        Yes, it's a weather website that contains a <code>.me</code> extension, but it was a free option.
                    </p>


                    <h2>Where I am now</h2>
                    <p>
                        I eventually had gotten another <code>.me</code> extension so I can host my own personal website, <a href="https://colinmurphrey.me">colinmurphrey.me</a>.
                        I am still working for my Associate's of Applied Science at the University of St. Thomas, along with my girlfriend.
                        Currently, I am also working at my school's IT department to gain experience to either work elsewhere or to be hired as an alumni worker.
                        My girlfriend and I are happy together with our stable ecosystem that I have designed, in which she has input for me to make changes and add features to Geoweather.
                        I have also used the Shortcuts app less, in favor of using Python and HTML and CSS.
                        I have not began any massive projects that involve coding after Geoweather (other than the website you are currently reading this blog post from), but I plan to document projects as than come about.
                        So stay tuned for that.
